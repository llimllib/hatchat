Let's create a unified color scheme and design for the site.

I want to try a very adult, calm color scheme with these major colors:

#1F1C1A | Coco’s Black
#3B3823 | Graphite
#8D7C55 | Mushroom Forest
#C6B7A0 | Another One Bites the Dust
#A4A0A1 | Shadow of the Colossus
#78798B | Your Shadow
#5B5958 | Stone Cold
#54311C | Peat Brown

I'd like the design to be square and understated where the slack style is rounded, childish and very colorful

Style the login page to match the chat app, and set them to use these colors when possible
