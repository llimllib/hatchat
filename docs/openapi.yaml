  title: Hatchat REST API
  description: |
    REST API for Hatchat, a Slack-like chat application.
    
    This API complements the WebSocket API for scenarios where REST is more appropriate,
    such as external integrations, simple queries, and tooling.
    
    ## Authentication
    
    All endpoints require authentication via session cookie. The cookie is set
    after successful login via the `/login` endpoint.
    
    ## Real-time Updates
    
    For real-time messaging, use the WebSocket API at `/ws`. This REST API is
    primarily for CRUD operations and querying state.
